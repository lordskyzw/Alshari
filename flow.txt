Car approaches gate
camera is working in real time picking up frames and checking for a number plate
when a number plate is detected, OCR is performed and plate number is captured


lines 1-3 are crucial for the whole process, they have to be reliable

after number is captured, it is then queried against the db
if the number is in the db, the gate is opened and an endpoint is hit notifying the car owner a welcome or exit message (this depends on the camera which picks up the image)

the gate is opened through a connection to the microcontroller
the microcontroller is connected to a relay switch
the relay switch is connected to the gate motor 
the gate motor is powered by a spearate 12 V or 24 V
