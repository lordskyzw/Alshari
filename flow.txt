- Car approaches gate
- camera is working in real time picking up frames
- the camera only looks for a number plate when it detects a car
- upon arrival of the car, the system searches for the number plate 3 times

- when a number plate is detected, OCR is performed and plate number is captured


NB: lines 1-6 are crucial for the whole process, they have to be reliable

- after number is captured, it is then queried against the db
- if the number is in the db, the gate is opened and an endpoint is hit notifying the car owner a welcome or exit message (this depends on the camera which picks up the image)

the gate is opened through a connection to the microcontroller
the microcontroller is connected to a relay switch
the relay switch is connected to the gate motor 
the gate motor is powered by a spearate 12 V or 24 V 
there is a three second delay
